<h3>Physical Education Department - Adding years to life, Adding life to years</h3>
<p>At Mayflower, the PE programme is centered around our motto of "Adding
years to life, adding life to years," promoting both physical fitness and
the holistic well-being of our students. Our PE programme offers students
a dynamic and comprehensive experience through a variety of activities
designed to develop their physical, social, and emotional well-being. Students
are introduced to six core sports: Frisbee, Floorball, and Badminton in
Lower Secondary, followed by Volleyball, Netball, and Softball in Upper
Secondary.</p>
<p>As part of the Outdoor Education module, students acquire essential skills
such as navigation, outdoor cooking, and shelter building. Highlights include
the 4D3N Secondary One Cohort Camp and the 5D4N MOE-OBS Challenge (MOC)
programme at Secondary Three, fostering resilience, teamwork, and self-reliance.</p>
<p>The curriculum also emphasizes fitness, nutrition, and safety. Students
gain basic first aid knowledge and participate in fitness assessments,
including the NAPFA test for Secondary 2 and 4/5 students and alternative
fitness tests for Secondary 1 and 3 students.</p>
<p>To promote community bonding and mass participation, the department organizes
events such as the annual Mayflower Cross Country race and Cohort Games,
bringing together staff and students in a celebration of fun and teamwork.</p>
<p>Our PE programme is committed to equipping students with lifelong skills,
knowledge, and values, enabling them to live fuller, active and healthier
lives both now and in the future.</p>
<h3>Music Department</h3>
<p>At Mayflower, our 2-year music programme provides every student with meaningful
experiences in dance and music. At the start of the year, students immerse
themselves in an exciting 8-week hip-hop and lyrical jazz dance module,
culminating in an inter-class dance competition. This engaging activity
nurtures performance confidence, fosters class spirit, and enhances their
sense of rhythmic pulse.Beyond dance, students explore musical performance
with instruments such as the ukulele, keyboard, and digital tools like
Garage Band and Bandlab. These hands-on experiences empower students to
make creative decisions in performing, composing, and listening to music.
To deepen students' appreciation for the arts, our curriculum includes
the Performing Arts-Based Learning (PABL) initiative, a collaborative effort
by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the National Arts Council (NAC).
Through PABL, every student experiences bespoke live music performances
in professional arts venues. This programme cultivates curiosity and pride
in local music and musicians while connecting classroom learning to real-world
music experiences.Our Music Department is dedicated to inspiring every
Mayflowerian to explore, appreciate, and excel in the performing arts.</p>
