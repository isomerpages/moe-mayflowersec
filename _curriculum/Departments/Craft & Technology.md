<p>The Mayflower Secondary Craft and Technology (C&amp;T) Department vision
was crafted in 2019 to provide our C&amp;T educators with a focal point
and a vision of the Mayflowerians that they will nurture through the C&amp;T
subjects. In conjunction with MOE’s drive to develop 21st century citizens,
this vision helps the department to align teaching and learning approaches
to ensure that the desired outcomes of the C&amp;T syllabi are achieved.
This vision also provides the foundation for our teachers’ continual reflection
and professional development, so as to strengthen the learning experiences
for our students.</p>

<h4>Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>The C&amp;T department advocates place-based pedagogy to support in-classroom
approaches towards teaching and learning. So as to contextualise what is
taught in the classroom to real world applications and experiences, students
are regularly invited to partake in learning activities in museums, artists’
studios and other industry affiliations. Students gain a deeper understanding
of how the knowledge gleaned in the classroom is applicable and has positively
impacted their community in the real world. Through their interaction with
industry practitioners, students will also identify with specific dispositions,
skills and attitudes that they need to emulate in order to further their
endeavour in the different craft and technological disciplines.</p>
<h4>Student-curated Exhibitions</h4>
<p>Student-curated exhibitions have become a department trademark in recent
years. We believe that these exhibitions provide opportunities for students
to exercise their communication, discernment and organisational skills
while they celebrate their learning progression and technical competencies
with the school community and invited guests. These exhibitions are a testimony
to the positive student outcomes that transpired from the department’s
curriculum design and pedagogical approaches.</p>
