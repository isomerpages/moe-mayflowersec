<h4><strong>Developing Curious Minds. Nurturing Generous Spirits. Preparing Future-Ready Mayflowerians.</strong></h4>
<p>At Mayflower Secondary School, Humanities education goes beyond academic
achievement.
<br>We nurture students who <strong>think critically, understand the world deeply, and contribute meaningfully to society</strong>.</p>
<p>Through Geography, History and Social Studies, our students develop the
skills, values and dispositions needed to thrive in a complex and interconnected
world.</p>

<h4><strong>What Learning Looks Like in Our Classrooms</strong></h4>
<p>Our students are active participants in their learning, not passive recipients
of information.</p>
<p><strong>In a Humanities classroom, you will often see students:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discussing real-world issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpreting data and case studies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating historical sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving and receiving peer feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting on their own thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using digital platforms to support inquiry</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our lessons intentionally develop:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Critical and adaptive thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and collaboration skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent learning habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence in expressing ideas using evidence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Signature Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Overseas Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, students participated in a Humanities Learning Journey to Vietnam.
Through site visits, guided inquiry and reflection, students deepened their
understanding of historical, cultural and socio-political contexts while
developing global awareness.</p>

<h4><strong>Inquiry &amp; Investigative Projects</strong></h4>
<p>Students regularly engage in authentic inquiry across levels, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Geographical fieldwork and investigations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historical source-based inquiry into Singapore’s past</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Studies projects exploring contemporary societal issues</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences strengthen research, reasoning and communication skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Competitions &amp; Talent Development</strong></h4>
<p>We encourage students to stretch their potential through platforms such
as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MOE Geography Challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOE History Challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROVE IT! Inter-school Challenge [evaluating reliability of information]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Promising students are also identified for further Humanities-related
enrichment opportunities.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Beyond the Classroom</strong></h4>
<p>Students benefit from a range of enrichment experiences including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning journeys and field experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guest speakers and expert talks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrichment workshops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of technology such as VR to enhance engagement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These opportunities make learning authentic, memorable and meaningful.</p>
<h4><strong>What Our Students Say</strong></h4>
<p><em>“What I love about Humanities in Mayflower is how </em><strong><em>engaging and meaningful</em></strong><em> the lessons are. They helped me </em><strong><em>better understand past events and social issues</em></strong><em>. At first, I was worried that Humanities would be about dull memorisation, but the subjects were taught in a way that made </em><strong><em>learning interactive and interesting</em></strong><em>. Instead of forcing myself to memorise facts, I learned to </em><strong><em>understand the causes and impacts</em></strong><em> of events, especially in History. Humanities also helped me learn how to </em><strong><em>break large amounts of content into smaller, more manageable ideas</em></strong><em>, making learning more </em><strong><em>meaningful and easier to remember</em></strong><em>.” - </em><strong><em>Yu Shan [2025 batch]</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>The most memorable Humanities lessons for me were the </em><strong><em>ones where my peers and I had to actively apply </em></strong><em>what we have learnt. In Sec 4, we were put into groups and </em><strong><em>made to take on different roles</em></strong><em> like government, community and individuals who were faced with potential security threats like transnational terrorism. It pushed me out of my usual “individual” mindset and forced me to see issues from broader perspectives.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The </em><strong><em>group discussions on societal issues</em></strong><em> made heavy Social Studies content easier to process. Using online platforms like Padlet also helped us organise our ideas more clearly. Overall, the mix of discussion and working regularly with my peers as well as learning through different platforms made everything more fun! That is honestly why upper secondary Social Studies lessons still stuck with me. - </em><strong><em>Wei Jian [2025 batch]</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>What I really loved about learning Humanities subjects at Mayflower was how the lessons were </em><strong><em>not just about learning content.</em></strong><em> They were about making learning </em><strong><em>meaningful and memorable. My Humanities teachers were always genuine, helpful, and supportive. </em></strong><em>They made lessons feel </em><strong><em>personal and engaging</em></strong><em> and that was a big part of why I grew a real passion for History and Social Studies.</em>
</p>
<p><em>One thing that made it feel so memorable was how teachers would bring in pop culture to help us understand History in a deeper way. I still remember when </em><strong><em>my History teacher shared the origins of the song</em></strong><em> “Forever Young”. She explained that it was shaped by Cold War-era anxiety in 1980s Europe, where people genuinely feared a nuclear war could happen. Soon after that, the song started trending everywhere. It felt really cool to know what the song was really about, while others were just enjoying it on the surface. - </em><strong><em>Nonidh [2024 Batch]</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>I’ve really </em><strong><em>enjoyed my geography journey.</em></strong><em> One of my most memorable experiences was our fieldwork at Punggol North Shore Plaza, where we observed and analysed how sustainable the mall is. It opened my eyes to </em><strong><em>how small design choices affect our daily lives. </em></strong><em>But what I appreciate most are our lessons — we </em><strong><em>can always ask questions, clear our doubts, and have meaningful discussions</em></strong><em> that help us understand geography on a deeper level. It’s made the subject genuinely enjoyable for me. – </em><strong><em>Ler Enn [2025 Batch]</em></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Our Hope for Every Mayflowerian</strong></h4>
<p>By the end of their humanities journey, we hope every student will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Think critically about the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate confidently and respectfully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate diverse perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care about societal issues</p>
