<p>Welcome to the Mayflower Humanities Department! Our department comprises
of a team of qualified and dedicated teachers who are passionate about
the study of humanities.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide students with an <strong>engaging and stimulating learning environment</strong> where
they can explore the diversity of human experience and gain a <strong>deep understanding</strong> of
key concepts, issues, and themes in our world today.</p>
<p>We recognize that <strong>every student is unique</strong> and thus believe
in using a <strong>variety of teaching methods that cater to diverse learning styles</strong> to
ensure that all students are able to develop their skills and achieve their
full potential and be able to thrive in our fast-changing world.</p>
<p>Our Humanities Department also prides itself on its inclusivity and commitment
to fostering a <strong>culture of respect, understanding, and tolerance</strong>.
We believe in providing a safe and nurturing environment where students
feel empowered to express themselves freely and grow intellectually and
personally.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we aim to put empower our students in the classroom <strong>by putting them in the driverâ€™s seat</strong>.</p>
<p>Our lessons are designed to develop in our students the <strong>dispositions needed to be an independent learner</strong>.
From peer to self-assessments and reflections, we nudge our students to
evaluate and defend their perspectives and answers.</p>
<p>With Blended Learning here to stay, our teachers have continued to <strong>leverage on technology</strong>.
In order to keep up with the changes, special emphasis has always been
placed on the professional development of our teachers. The Humanities
teachers work together to design learning experiences tapping on the affordances
of technology to promote self-regulated learning. Teachers attend workshops
and share ways to differentiate learning in the classroom so that students
can learn at their own pace.</p>
<p>At Mayflower, we also believe in creating opportunities for our students
to further their <strong>learning beyond the classroom</strong>. We offer
field trips, sessions with guest speakers, enrichment activities and exposure
to competitions that complement the curriculum and provide students with
practical experiences that enhance their learning.</p>
<p>At the end of the school experience at Mayflower, we hope to have imparted
in our students the love and appreciation of the humanities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to know more about our curriculum,
please contact us.</p>
<h2>Notable Programmes &amp; Events</h2>
<h4>Investigative Projects</h4>
<p>With inquiry-based learning as the cornerstone, students of all levels
embark on Geographical Investigations. Lower Secondary students also work
on historical sources to make sense of the past and form interpretations
and conclusions relating to Singapore's history. In Social Studies classes,
our Secondary 3 students and all NT students, embark on various projects
to better understand current societal issues.</p>
<h4>MOE Geography/History Challenge</h4>
<p>Every year, we send a team of students to participate in the Geography
and History MOE Challenges. By doing so, our students are given the opportunity
to learn deeply and go beyond the syllabus. These competitions have also
been an excellent way to talent-spot promising students. These students
are offered to join the Talent Development Programme specifically meant
for students keen to pursue these humanities subjects at the A level.</p>
<h4>PROVE IT! Competition</h4>
<p>Selected lower secondary students take part in this inter-school challenge
that examines their ability to evaluate for reliable information, an important
life skill in these times.</p>
