<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in English Curriculum</h3>
<p>This is the 5th&nbsp;year of a four-year progressive ALP in Effective
Communication where students are given the opportunities to hone their
speaking and writing skills via various platforms to be confident communicators.
The ALP aims to develop effective communication skills within students
whereby they are encouraged to express their ideas and opinions clearly
and effectively taking into consideration the Purpose, Audience and Context.</p>
<h4>Speech and Drama Programme</h4>

<p>The Secondary 1 students explore drama and stage presentations in Semester
1. During the course of the programme, students tap on their creativity
to craft and flesh out scripts in lessons, and learn stage directions and
masterful use of voice to produce an entertaining skit. The EL teachers
parallel the ALP sessions by encouraging students to turn an inward eye
and reflect on their own progress and learning during the Reading lessons.
The winning teams stage their skits during assembly programmes or the ALP
Showcase session.</p>
<h4>Journalism and Broadcast Programme</h4>
<p>The Secondary 2 students participate in Journalism and Broadcast programme
in Term 2. With the objective to develop students to be confident communicators,
especially in the context of Journalism and Broadcast, the training sessions
are truly proof of what teamwork, effort and training can do to help students
to become confident presenters. The trainings would culminate to learning
journeys to related organisations which further stimulate the students
in their learning. Such ALP programmes are definitely welcomed by the Lower
Secondary students as they find many exciting moments to collaborate with
each other to complete their projects. The group presentations that feature
students’ news reporting, photo journalism and feature articles, best capture
their journey of discovery in a vibrant manner. Such rich ALP opportunities,
more importantly, help the school spot our talent.</p>
<h4>Debates and Public Presentations</h4>
<p>Our Upper secondary students are exposed to an array of activities such
as presentations and debates. The capable ones from all levels are identified
and trained to be student emcees and presenters at the school events as
well as competitive events beyond school.</p>
<h3>Literature Curriculum</h3>

<p>In the Literature curriculum, there are plenty of opportunities for students
to engage in Joyful learning through fun activities. For example, students
are exposed to recreating dramatic and significant moments by varied learning
approaches such as making 3-dimensional models, dioramas, posters, comic
strips, clever arrangements of newspaper clippings, role-plays, video clips,
and sometimes even a treasure hunt. From their research and group presentations,
there is much emphasis on the value of teamwork and collaboration learning.
The Secondary 1 Express students are encouraged to showcase their projects
based on their Literature set text The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Our
upper secondary literature students are exposed to debates and skits and
those in ALP Tier 2 are stretched to participate in assembly programmes,
debates and competitive events beyond school such as PESA and ACJC Orator’s
Trophy. The department also organises Literature Virtual Experience (Sec
1) as well as Learning Journeys to Peranakan Museum (Sec 2) related to
the set texts, engaging students in exploration of setting, characterisation
and theme. Such sessions are abuzz and engaging as students are urged to
pose questions to the presenters and even write mini reflections and words
of encouragement for their friends. Over the years, there have been a variety
of mixed media products presented that demonstrated students’ interpretation
and understanding of the Literature textbooks. As a whole, students are
always encouraged to be empathetic through characterisation and role-plays
make insightful connections between the novel and the contemporary world
issues.</p>
