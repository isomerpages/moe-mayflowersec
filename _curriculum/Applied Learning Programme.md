<p>The ALP aims to address the increasing trend in the use of media as a
platform of communication in the 21st century. Through the three-year progressive
programmes, students will hone their speaking and writing skills via various
platforms to be confident communicators. At Mayflower, Effective Communication
(EC) focuses on equipping students with lifelong skills via language learning.
As a school, we believe in providing a myriad of opportunities for all
students to develop their communicative skills in everyday, real life situations.
The EC provides plenty of authentic learning experiences for our students
to enable them to acquire both creative and critical thinking skills. The
English Department and the Mother Tongue are the main drivers of the EC
organised level-wide programmes.</p>

<p>The EL department organises programmes such as Speech and Drama, Journalism
and Broadcast, Debates and Public Presentations for all the levels both
within their EL curriculum and beyond the curriculum as enrichment programmes.
ALP experiences are anchored on EL learning outcomes and focus on the learning
beyond that of the classroom. During the ALP sessions, students reflect
upon the importance of voice, visualisation and perspectives in storytelling
and news reporting, thereby becoming effective communicators. The sessions
also provide students with hands-on experiences such as script writing,
speech presentations and journalistic news reports. Students are also exposed
to impromptu presentations and explored ‘unknown’ elements in real-life
reporting and storytelling that required them to think on their feet and
respond critically. On some occasions, there are also opportunities presented
to EL ALP students to showcase their talent during assemblies and lunch
time. Such presentations are usually received with much excitement and
buzz by their peers. The EL ALP Tier 2 students are encouraged to participate
in competitions beyond the school such as PESA, ACJC Debate Series and
Toastmasters sessions. The learning in these workshops are undoubtedly
very enriching and exciting for students.</p>

<p>The MTL ALP aims to provide authentic learning experiences, riding on
the foundation of language skills taught in EL ALP, based on the students’
interests. The learning experiences are customised based on the profile
and interests of the students, by providing them different platforms and
opportunities to use the MT languages and code switch to apply the skills
taught in EL ALP.</p>

<p>There is a swivel effect where the Secondary 1 students learn Speech &amp;
Drama skills for their EL ALP and in Secondary 2 have opportunities to
express it in MT in a different context. Similarly, the Secondary 2 students
learn basic skills of Journalism &amp; Broadcasting and apply it in the
current affairs using MT in Sec 3. The focus for our Secondary 1 students
will be on reading skills related to rhetoric and characterization. Customising
to the interests and profile of Sec 1 NA &amp; NT students, the programme
will focus on students learning storyboarding via hands-on activities.
By creating their own story, they learn logical thinking and dialogue writing
(different forms of effective communication).</p>

<p>For Talent Development, students with interest and aptitude are encouraged
to sign up for the different masterclasses organised by the MT department.
For students who are interested in levelling up their language skills in
translation (Chinese to English, vice-versa) and debate (in Chinese Language
and Malay Language), we have the translation and debate training workshops
where students learn the basic techniques of translation and debating using
their MT languages. Students taking Chinese Language will also be engaged
in a series of mind-twisting translation challenges in our annual MTL Fortnight
Cultural Camp. Students also participated in translation and debate competitions.</p>

<p>Our text recital workshops help Sec 1 &amp; 2 HCL students explore the
voice techniques and promote their reading and oral competency. The trainings
include different reciting styles, methods and techniques, from learning
how to project their voices across a stage to conveying emotion on cue.
Selected students will then participate in the National Recital Competition,
practising the skills they learnt in class. We also appoint 2 Malay Language
students as Malay Language Ambassadors for Rakan Bahasa every year. Through
this exposure, our Malay Language Ambassadors are able to spread their
love for the Malay Language by being role models to their family and peers.
They are also able to enrich the lives of others through creative expression
and usage of the Malay Language. Our Malay Ambassadors are given opportunities
to undergo confidence-building and public speaking skills training. With
these, they are given opportunities in school to promote activities related
to the Malay Language.</p>
