<h2>The Mayflower Academic Programme</h2>
<p>The Mayflower [MF] curriculum is designed to prepare our students for
the future. The recent paradigm shift in education has meant that the distinct
roles of teachers and learners have become increasingly blurred, and education
is no longer defined in terms of what a teacher will teach but rather in
terms of what a student will be able to demonstrate. Consequently, we have
been refining the way in which the MF curriculum is structured and technology
is being harnessed to maximize learning.</p>
<p>Another key focus of ours has been to help our students ‘lift the lid’;
eradicate limiting beliefs in the face of challenges and aim high and believe
in one’s potential and ability to succeed with fortitude.</p>
<h4>Learner-Centred Pedagogies</h4>
<p>At Mayflower, we constantly strive to bring about a student–centred curriculum
in a nurturing environment. Across departments, learning experiences have
been changing to promote active learning in the classroom. Problem-solving
and inquiry-based approaches are used pervasively to promote the exploratory
nature in learning. Subjects are also taught in a way that allows students
to appreciate its relevance in real world contexts.</p>
<h4>Assessment for Learning</h4>
<p>As students become active learners, assessment for learning has naturally
become an integral part of our curriculum to ensure clarity in learning
intention for both teachers and students. This is because in order to be
responsible for what a student learns, we must first understand WHAT a
student knows before new learning begins and HOW best to build on what
each student already knows. Lessons are thus purposefully crafted to promote
more self-regulated learning.</p>
<h4>Customisation</h4>
<p>At Mayflower, we recognize that every student is unique and so conscious
effort is made to customize pedagogy and programmes so that no student
is left behind. Our curriculum plans reflect the student segmentation and
the spiral development of competencies and skills from Lower Secondary
to Upper Secondary. To cater to students’ needs, interests and intrinsic
motivation to learning, Advanced Elective Modules, Elective Modules and
Life Skills workshops are conducted.</p>
<p>To help students who are struggling with subjects, the school also conducts
targeted remediation, consultations and programmes to help these students
catch up with their peers. Students with special needs are also supported
by a team of teachers to help them cope better in school.</p>

<p>In line with preparing our students for the future, we have a comprehensive
programme to develop Mayflowerians into effective communicators. Broad
based programmes [Tier 1] targeted at the entire school population are
planned and run by the English Language and Mother Tongue departments throughout
the year. Specialised programmes are spiralled to Tier 2 level whereby
selected students with talents and who show interest are trained and coached
for greater exposure such as competitions.</p>

</div>
<p>The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020
to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with digital literacies
to be future-ready. As part of NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every secondary
school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD)
by the end-2021. Other than to support the development of digital literacies,
the NDLP also aims to enhance teaching and learning while supporting self-directed
and collaborative learning.</p>

<h3>Dedicated and Capable Staff of Teachers</h3>
<p>All of these changes being made would not be possible without our dedicated
team of teachers and staff. As the role of teachers is to be a guide now
instead of an expert spewing knowledge, teachers at Mayflower has been
investing a lot of time and effort on learning how to maximise learning
in a totally different setting. The goal is to turn classes where students
are learning how to learn and discover knowledge with a teacher's coaching
guidance. Find out how this is done by the different departments by clicking
on the different departments highlighted below.</p>
