<h3>Secondary Three</h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Visit</strong>
<br>To encourage our Secondary 3 students to start thinking of their ‘end
goal’ they visited various industries of their choice to get a first-hand
exposure of the working environment. Sengkang General Hospital, LTA, Conrad
Centennial Singapore, IMH are some of the industries we partnered with
for this experience. Students met enthusiastic professionals within the
organization, who not only sparked their interest in joining the field
in future, but also debunk any myths or misconceptions.</p>

<h2>Support Programmes</h2>
<p><strong>MFSS Bursary Award</strong>
</p>
<p>Our partners in education - MFSS Alumni and Parents Support Group and
the Rotary Club Changi have been generously contributing to this pool of
bursaries, ensuring that these students are not left behind in the pursuit
of their dreams due to financial challenges.</p>

students to promote a greater sense of belonging to school and Singapore.</p>
