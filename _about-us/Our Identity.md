### Our School Crest &amp; Motto
<img src="/images/crest.svg" style="width:25%">

The Mayflower Secondary School crest and motto symbolise who we are and what we stand for as a school community. They represent our heritage, our aspirations, and our commitment to developing students of character and purpose.

The school crest is formed from the letters **MF**, the initials of Mayflower Secondary School. The letter **M** is artistically shaped like a flower, while the letter **F** is designed as a stem with two blades of leaves. Together, they form a stalk of flower, conveying the belief that **“Every Mayflowerian will bloom.”**

The design also symbolises the pursuit of knowledge. The stylised red **M** represents the **torch of wisdom**, while the green leaves resemble an **open book**, reflecting growth through learning. Green further symbolises the continuous quest for knowledge, just as leaves seek nourishment for growth.

The letter **M** is linked to the concept of **“might,”** from which the school motto **“Mighty in Thought and Deed”** is derived. The bold lettering of the school name, arranged in a circle around the crest, reflects unity and collective strength in striving to be righteous in both thought and action.

### Mayflower Promise
The Mayflower Promise expresses our shared identity and direction as a school. It articulates the kind of person we seek to develop in every student and guides our decisions, practices and relationships across the school.

**Our school values are intentionally aligned to the Mayflower Promise.** They bring the Promise to life by describing how a Mayflowerian thinks, acts and contributes to everyday situations, shaping out culture and community.

<div align="center">
Mayflower our dearest school <br>
Together aspire together we strive; <br>  
From thee we derive  <br>
The knowledge and the dignity  <br>
To thee we give our love and loyalty.<br><br>
Mayflower, Mayflower,  <br>
To fame and glory, to fame and glory;  <br>
Mayflower, Mayflower,  <br>
We serve and honour our school and country.<br><br>
Be mighty in thought and deed  <br>
Be modest to all men no matter what creed;  <br>
Onward we'll march  <br>
with kindred and spirit aglow  <br>
And that is our motto for a better tomorrow.
