<p>The original Mayflower Secondary School building was built at a cost of
$5.46 million on a 2.7 hectares plot of land along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3
in the then new Ang Mo Kio Satellite Town. The school started in 1981 with
408 students and became one of the more popular neighbourhood schools in
this area.</p>

<p>Mr Selamat Alvie designed the original school logo, with the letters MSS
enclosed by a set of upward pointing and downward pointing arrow-heads.
Mrs Yang Peng Hwa introduced the school motto, “Magnanimity and Modesty”
which was incorporated into the logo.</p>
<p>Mr Wan Hussin wrote the lyrics of the School Song while Mr John De Souza
composed the music, arranged by Mr Ho Eng Kheng.</p>
<p>In September 1981, Mr Ibrahim Othman took over from Mr Wan Hussin, who
was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Culture.</p>
<p>The School was officially opened on 15 July 1983 by the then Member of
Parliament of Kebun Baru, Mr Lim Boon Heng.</p>

<p>A new school logo and school motto was introduced in 1993, together with
the change of the school initials from “MSS” to “MF”. The new logo has
the letters MF encompassed by the school name. “MF”, the initials of the
school, are depicted as a stalk of flower which conveys the essence of
the school philosophy, that “Every Mayflowerian Will Bloom”.</p>
<p>The new school motto became “Be Mighty In Thought and Deed”, an exaltation
taken from the school song. The motto was shortened to “Mighty In Thought
And Deed” in the new millennia.</p>
<p>Guest of Honour Mr Inderjit Singh, then Member of Parliament for Ang Mo
Kio GRC and former Principal Mr Wan Hussin graced Mayflower’s 20th Anniversary
Dinner in April 2001 and this was to be our last anniversary dinner at
the old school building.</p>

<p>Due to space constraint, Mayflower functioned from two campuses for 5
years from 2001, Campus 1 being at the original school site and Campus
2, at the former Bowen Secondary School, down the road.</p>

<p>Fund raising projects were undertaken from 2002 to 2004 for our new school
building and a memorable one was the National Day Food &amp; Funfair held
on 9 August 2003 whereby Kebun Baru constituents joined in, together with
our Guest-of-Honour, Mr Inderjit Singh, then Member of Parliament for Ang
Mo Kio GRC.</p>
<p>A Homecoming Dinner was held on 28 August 2004 whereby 500 alumni and
staff turned up to have an evening of reminiscence before the old building
was torn down.</p>

<p>The new campus, complete with a 200-seat theatrette and dance studio,
was completed in 2005 and Mayflower once again came together under one
roof, our new building being sited on the combined parcel of land of the
old Campus 1 and Ang Mo Kio Primary School, formerly Ai Tong Primary School.</p>
