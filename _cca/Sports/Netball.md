<blockquote>
<p>Never let good enough be enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our CCA, Netball, we want every individual to achieve their fullest
potential in their physical, mental and social skills. Our guiding principles
of perseverance and hard work and our emphasis on team effort, team building
and team bonding make up the dynamics of our team. Our CCA leaders have
always taken on the role of organisers, planning our Secondary 4 graduation
party, our day camp and CCA Open house as part of their leadership training.
This also helps to foster closer bonds amongst our CCA members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Netball team is currently training under Coach Sue who started coaching
us at the end of 2017. Coach Sue comes to us with many years of coaching
experience and we have seen great improvements both individually and as
a team. Coach Sue may be strict at times but never fails to show care and
concern during training. She puts in her heart and soul in teaching us
and never fails to correct us whenever we make mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also want to take this opportunity to show our appreciation to our
celebrity star coach, Ms Paige Chua. Ms Chua drops by to coach and mentor
whenever she can, despite her busy schedule. She is a role model for our
students, having graduated from Mayflower as Netball Captain and Vice-President
of Student Councillor, and is currently an active member of our school
Alumni.</p>
<p><strong>Training sessions:</strong>&nbsp;Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3 pm
to 6 pm</p>
