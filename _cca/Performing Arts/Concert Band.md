<h3>History</h3>
<p>Founded in 1981, the Mayflower Secondary School Concert Band aspires to
nurture talents, build friendship through music and create music that reaches
the listener's heart.</p>
<p>We enrich our members' musical experiences through local and overseas
exchange programmes, and through performance opportunities at school as
well as public events. Our members also contribute actively through various
community outreach programmes and service-learning activities.</p>
<p>We have had the privilege to perform at the Istana, the Istana Park, Merlion
Park, etc., and also get to showcase our members’ musical skills at numerous
local public concerts. Our repertoire includes pieces from the standard
symphonic pieces to pop music pieces from all over the world, and members
are often exposed to challenging pieces that require strong teamwork and
determination to deliver.</p>
<p>As our students undergo the process of rehearsing in the band, either
for foot drills or music drills, the organised routines allow them to learn
the values of discipline, teamwork, responsibility and commitment. As they
participate in competitions, students also learn to celebrate their achievements
while maintaining humility or even to accept defeat in good grace. These
are valuable experiences that our members will gain in the four or five
years they are with us.</p>
<p>We take pride in developing potential young musicians. Many of our members
have graduated and gone on to involve themselves in the bands in the junior
colleges, other institutes of higher learning, as well as the Singapore
Wind Symphony. Some have even continued to pursue professional art or music
career.</p>
