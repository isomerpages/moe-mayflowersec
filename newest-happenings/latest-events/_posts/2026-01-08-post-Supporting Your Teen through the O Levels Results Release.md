<p>Dear Parents/Guardians</p>
<p>The 2025 O-Level results will be released on <strong>Wednesday, 14 Jan at 2pm</strong>.
While we await the results, let us also remember to celebrate their efforts,
regardless of the results. We can show support for our teens by showing
them through our words and actions that their grades do not define who
they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your support to your teen during this milestone is important. Use this
opportunity to have open conversations and guide them as they consider
their next steps.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Resources for Parents</strong></h3>
