We are proud to inform that Ms Eileen Chew, our Head of Department for Mother Tongue, was one of the ten teachers who received the Distinguished Chinese Language Teachers Awards. This award aims to recognise outstanding Chinese language teachers who have been exemplary in the teaching of the language and culture.

In line with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) shift to focus on self-directed and blended learning, Ms Eileen Chew Qian Ru, 34, who is head of the mother tongue department in Mayflower Secondary school, fully embraced technology to engage with her students.

In appreciation for receiving the award, Ms Chew said: "When I rally (my teachers), everyone really works towards a common cause. In terms of getting this award, they definitely played a part in it."
