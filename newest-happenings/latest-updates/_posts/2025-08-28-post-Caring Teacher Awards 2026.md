<p>🌟 <strong>Caring Teacher Award 2026</strong> 🌟</p>
<p>At Mayflower, we are blessed with teachers who do more than just teach.
They inspire, encourage and walk alongside us in our learning journeys.
❤</p>
<p>The Caring Teacher Award (CTA) 2026 is your chance to say "thank you"
to that teacher who has made a difference in your life - whether it’s through
their kind words, extra support or the way they motivate you to keep going.
